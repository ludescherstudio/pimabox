> *Pima* (Swahili) — to measure, to assess.
> **pima Analytics** does exactly that: it measures your website traffic. No cloud. No complexity. Just your data, on your hosting.

**Cookie-free, GDPR-compliant website analytics for PHP shared hosting.**

No Node.js. No Docker. No external database. No cookies. No consent banner.
Just upload four files, add a few lines to your existing `.htaccess` and `robots.txt`, paste one snippet — done.

Designed for beginners — if you can upload files via FTP and edit a text file, you can run pima Analytics. Works on any website: static HTML, WordPress, or any PHP-based site.

## What's in this repository

Only the four files you actually need:

```
pima.php             ← Dashboard (served at /pima and /analytics)
pima-tracker.php     ← Tracking pixel endpoint
pima-core.php        ← Configuration (passwords, branding, timezone)
pima-cache/
└── .htaccess        ← Blocks direct access to the SQLite database
```

No `.htaccess` in the project root, no `robots.txt`. You almost certainly already have both — the instructions below show exactly which lines to add to your existing files.

---

## Installation

### Step 1 — Upload the files

Upload all four files to your web root via FTP, keeping the structure intact:

```
your-webroot/
├── pima.php
├── pima-tracker.php
├── pima-core.php
└── pima-cache/
    └── .htaccess
```

Make sure `pima-cache/` is writable by PHP (permissions `0750` on most shared hosts). The SQLite database is created automatically on the first page view.

### Step 2 — Set your passwords, timezone and language

Open `pima-core.php` and edit these lines:

```php
// --- Auth ---
define('STATS_PASSWORD', 'your-dashboard-password');

// --- Tracker token ---
define('TRACKER_TOKEN', 'my-secret-word');

// --- Timezone ---
define('TIMEZONE', 'Europe/Vienna'); // full list: php.net/timezones

// --- Language ---
define('LANG', 'en'); // 'en' = English, 'de' = German
```

> **Why two passwords?**
> The **tracker token** appears in every tracked page's HTML source — anyone can see it. It only allows *writing* hits, not reading your dashboard. Your **dashboard password** stays completely secret and is never exposed in your code.
>
> **Important:** Use a different value for the tracker token than any of your existing passwords — since it's visible in your source code, treat it as a public identifier, not a secret.

### Step 3 — Add two lines to your existing `.htaccess`

Your project root almost certainly already has a `.htaccess`. Open it and append this block at the end:

```apache
# pima analytics
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^pima$       pima.php [L]
RewriteRule ^analytics$  pima.php [L]
<Files "pima-core.php">
    Require all denied
</Files>
Options -Indexes
```

What each line does:

| Line | Purpose | Safe to skip if… |
|---|---|---|
| `RewriteEngine On` | Enables the rewrite rules below | …it already appears earlier in your file |
| `RewriteRule ^pima$ pima.php [L]` | Maps `/pima` → `pima.php` | Never — required for the dashboard URL |
| `RewriteRule ^analytics$ pima.php [L]` | Maps `/analytics` → `pima.php` | Never — required for the alternate URL |
| `<Files "pima-core.php">…</Files>` | Blocks web access to your password and token | Only if the same file is already denied elsewhere |
| `Options -Indexes` | Disables directory listings | …it already appears earlier |

> **Older Apache (2.2)?** Replace `Require all denied` with:
> ```apache
> Order Allow,Deny
> Deny from all
> ```

> **No `.htaccess` at all?** Create one in your web root with exactly the block above.

### Step 4 — Add four lines to your existing `robots.txt`

Your project root almost certainly already has a `robots.txt`. Open it and — inside the `User-agent: *` section — append:

```
Disallow: /pima
Disallow: /analytics
Disallow: /pima-tracker.php
Disallow: /pima-cache/
```

> **No `robots.txt` at all?** Create one in your web root with:
> ```
> User-agent: *
> Disallow: /pima
> Disallow: /analytics
> Disallow: /pima-tracker.php
> Disallow: /pima-cache/
> ```

### Step 5 — Add the tracking snippet

Replace `my-secret-word` with the value you set for `TRACKER_TOKEN` in Step 2.

**Static HTML sites**

Paste this snippet directly before the closing `</body>` tag of every page you want to track — or better, into your shared footer file (`footer.php`, `partials/footer.php`, `includes/footer.html`, …) so it appears on every page automatically.

```html
<script>
fetch('/pima-tracker.php?p=' + encodeURIComponent(location.pathname)
  + '&title=' + encodeURIComponent(document.title)
  + '&r=' + encodeURIComponent(document.referrer)
  + '&t=my-secret-word');
</script>
```

**WordPress**

Open **Appearance → Theme File Editor → functions.php** and paste this at the end of the file:

```php
function pima_tracker() { ?>
<script>
fetch('/pima-tracker.php?p=' + encodeURIComponent(location.pathname)
  + '&title=' + encodeURIComponent(document.title)
  + '&r=' + encodeURIComponent(document.referrer)
  + '&t=my-secret-word');
</script>
<?php }
add_action('wp_footer', 'pima_tracker');
```

This runs automatically on every page — no need to touch individual posts or templates.

> **Critical:** Never insert the snippet twice on the same rendered page (e.g. once in a shared footer *and* again on an individual page). Every hit would be double-counted.

### Done.

Open `yourdomain.com/pima` or `yourdomain.com/analytics` in your browser, enter your dashboard password, and watch your traffic come in.

### Step 6 — Make it yours (optional)

Open `pima-core.php` and adapt the dashboard to match your site:

```php
// --- Branding ---
define('BRAND_COLOR', '#0d9488'); // any hex color, e.g. '#c0392b' for red
define('BRAND_LOGO',  '');        // path or URL to your logo (see below)
define('BRAND_NAME',  'pima'); // change this to your site name
```

**Adding your logo:**

```php
// Option A — file on your server (recommended)
define('BRAND_LOGO', '/assets/logo.svg');

// Option B — full URL
define('BRAND_LOGO', 'https://yourdomain.com/assets/logo.png');
```

Supported formats: SVG, PNG, JPG, WebP. The logo appears centered above the summary sentence. Leave empty to show `BRAND_NAME` as text instead.

---

## Language

pima Analytics ships in English and German. Set your language in `pima-core.php`:

```php
define('LANG', 'en'); // 'en' = English, 'de' = German
```

**Adding your own language** takes about 5 minutes — open `pima.php`, find the `$strings` array, copy the `'en'` block, give it a new key (e.g. `'fr'`), translate the strings, and set `LANG` to `'fr'` in your config. All dashboard labels, tooltips, and messages will follow.

---

## Security

pima Analytics is designed to be reasonably secure out of the box for a self-hosted tool on shared hosting.

**What's protected:**
- `pima-core.php` is blocked from web access via `.htaccess` — no one can read your password from the browser
- `pima-cache/` is fully blocked — the SQLite database cannot be downloaded directly
- The login form has **brute-force protection**: after 5 failed attempts, the form locks out for 15 minutes (configurable in `pima-core.php`)
- After a successful login, the session ID is regenerated to prevent session fixation attacks
- All inputs to `pima-tracker.php` are safely bound using SQLite3 prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- The **tracker token** (`TRACKER_TOKEN`) ensures only your own snippet can write hits — preventing fake data from being injected

**Important:** pima Analytics should only be used on sites with HTTPS. The login password is sent via POST — over plain HTTP it would be visible in transit. Most shared hosts provide free SSL — make sure it's active.

**Configuring lockout settings:**
```php
define('MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS', 5);    // Failed attempts before lockout
define('LOCKOUT_SECONDS',    900);  // Lockout duration (900 = 15 minutes)
```

## What gets tracked

| Field | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Date | `2026-04-15` | Server date |
| Time | `14:32:01` | Server time |
| Page | `/blog/hello-world` | URL path |

## Configuration reference

All settings in `pima-core.php`:

```php
define('STATS_PASSWORD',     'change-me');                           // Dashboard password
define('TRACKER_TOKEN',      'my-secret-word');                      // Second password for tracking snippet
define('TIMEZONE',           'Europe/Vienna');                       // php.net/timezones

define('BRAND_NAME',         'pima');                                     // Shown in header and browser tab
define('BRAND_LOGO',         '');                                    // Path to self-hosted logo image
define('DB_PATH',            __DIR__.'/pima-cache/analytics.db');    // SQLite database location
define('GEO_ENABLED',        true);                                  // Country lookup via ip-api.com
define('EXCLUDED_IPS',       []);                                    // Your own IPs to ignore
define('TRUST_PROXY',        false);                                 // Enable only behind a trusted CDN/proxy
define('MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS', 5);                                     // Failed attempts before lockout
define('LOCKOUT_SECONDS',    900);                                   // Lockout duration (900 = 15 min)
define('RECENT_ENTRIES',     50);                                    // Rows in recent hits table
define('TREND_DAYS',         14);                                    // Days shown in trend chart
define('ADVANCED_MODE',      false);                                 // Enable danger zone in dashboard
```

## Privacy & GDPR

- No cookies — no consent banner needed
- IPs used only for country lookup, then discarded — **never written to disk**
- Only the country code (e.g. `AT`) is stored, not the IP
- All data stays on your own server
- For zero external requests: set `GEO_ENABLED = false`

---

## Advanced Mode

For power users who want extra control. Disabled by default — won't appear for regular users.

Enable it in `pima-core.php`:

```php
define('ADVANCED_MODE', true);
```

This adds a **Danger Zone** section at the bottom of the dashboard with:
- Database info (file size, row count)
- **Clear all data** — permanently deletes all analytics rows (requires confirmation)

Disable again by setting it back to `false`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No data yet" — dashboard stays empty

The most common reason: the tracking snippet is missing or the token is wrong.

1. Open your page in the browser, right-click → View Page Source, and search for `pima-tracker.php` — if it's not there, the snippet wasn't added correctly
2. Make sure the token in your snippet matches `TRACKER_TOKEN` in `pima-core.php` exactly — it's case-sensitive
3. Check that the `pima-cache/` folder exists on your server. If it's missing, create it manually via FTP and set permissions to `0750`
4. To test the tracker directly, open `yourdomain.com/pima-tracker.php?p=/test&t=YOUR_TOKEN` in your browser — you should see a blank white page (1×1 pixel), not an error

### Login doesn't work

Open `pima-core.php` and check `STATS_PASSWORD` — watch out for extra spaces or special characters that your text editor may have added. The password is case-sensitive.

If you're locked out after too many attempts, wait 15 minutes or increase `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` temporarily.

### Dashboard is completely blank

This is usually a PHP syntax error in `pima-core.php`. Check that your password doesn't contain special characters like `$` or `'` — if it does, choose a simpler password with only letters and numbers.

### Country detection not working

Your host may have `allow_url_fopen` disabled. Set `GEO_ENABLED = false` in `pima-core.php` to disable country lookup — everything else will continue to work normally.

### `/pima` or `/analytics` returns a 404

`mod_rewrite` may be disabled on your server, or `.htaccess` files may not be allowed. Contact your host and ask them to enable `mod_rewrite` and `AllowOverride All`.

### Your own visits are showing up in the stats

Add your IP address to `EXCLUDED_IPS` in `pima-core.php`:
```php
define('EXCLUDED_IPS', ['your.ip.address']);
```
You can find your current IP at [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com).

### Something looks wrong and you're not sure why

Try clearing the cache: connect via FTP, open the `pima-cache/` folder, and delete everything except `.htaccess`. The database will be recreated automatically on the next page visit. You can also do this from the dashboard if `ADVANCED_MODE` is enabled.

---

## Honest limitations

- **Daily unique visitors only** — pima Analytics counts unique visitors per day using an anonymous hash (salt rotates every 24h, so the same person on two different days cannot be correlated). This is intentional: no cookies, no cross-day tracking, no fingerprinting. The "Today" KPI is accurate; all-time "unique visitors" would be meaningless with this design and is deliberately not shown.
- **Not for high-traffic sites** — SQLite handles millions of rows comfortably, but concurrent write spikes (500+ simultaneous visitors) may cause brief delays.
- **No real-time view** — dashboard reflects data as written to the database.

---

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- Apache with `.htaccess` support (standard on all shared hosts)
- SQLite3 and PDO_SQLITE extensions enabled (standard on all major hosts)
- `allow_url_fopen` (only for country detection)
- HTTPS (strongly recommended)
